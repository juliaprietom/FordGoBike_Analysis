# FordGoBike exploration
## by Julia Prieto


## Dataset

>The data consisted of approximately 174,952 (clean) entries all belonging to February of 2019. In total this set contains 16 features/columns (duration, start time, end time, start station id, start station name, start station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude, bike id, user type, member birth year, member gender, bike share for all). There is a mix between numeric and categorical variables.


## Summary of Findings

> The majority of FordGoBike users are males, making up for almost 75% of total users. Not surprisingly, males also make up for the majority of subscribers.

>The majority of FordGoBike's users fall in the range of 25-35 years old followed by people in their mid30s and 40s. Users above 55 years old are rare, and the second least common group are those aged 18-24. This is visualized with a distribution plot below.

>9.5% of FordGoBike users in February of 2019 were subscribers. 75% of subscribers were male, followed by a 22.8% females and 2% for other genders. This distribution is nearly identical to that of the overall users.

>The most popular stations overall saw an overwhelming majority of subscribers over casual users for both start and return station.

>Most bikes are rented on Thursday mornings. Overall, the most popular time to rent FordGoBikes was between 8-10 AM followed by 4-6 PM as shown in the heatmap below.

>Overall, males tend to use bikes for a shorter period of time than females and other genders with an average of <15 minutes. Other genders tend to have the highest duration, usually over 15 minutes. While weekends are not the most popular time to rent, they are the days in which all genders tend to bike for longer.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1. Males make up for most users, and they sow a distinctive use of the bikes, by only riding for an average of barely over 10 minutes, renting bikes at specific times (8-10AM, 4-6PM)and frequenting the most popular stations around the city. How is this important? By understanding more about the audiences demographics we could inform future marketing campaigns. Are these stations located near to our subscribers homes/workplaces, are bikes being rented mostly to go to work? These are questions that we cannot answer based solely on the data provided, but this data has given us a good start at better understanding our target audience.

> 2. Bikes are usually rented for short amount of times, meaning they are used more for transportation than enjoyment. Knowing the average time bikes are rented for can help FordGoBike in future plans for expansion by considering distance between stations.

> 3. The most popular stations overall are those most frequented by subscribers. Although subscribers make only 9.5% of all users, they are the ones who most frequent those stations that stood out as most popular.
